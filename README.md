Problem Statement:
Creating an Insurance Management System for users with different functionalities depending upon user role (Customer/Admin). 


Idea:

Customer Input:
1. Name
2. Age
3. Insurance type( Health or Vehicle or both)
4. Credit Score
5. Email/phone
6. Monthly premium range (Select option)
7. Tenure.


Customer:
First time users sign up to the application. The user is presented with multiple options of health coverage and Vehicle Insurance coverage.
The customer enters all his relevant personal data through secure forms. This data is stored in the database.
Based on the information given by the client, a monthly premium is calculated and a billing page is shown.
When a customer wants to claim his/her insurance, there is a ‘claim’ page for generating requests and for tracking those requests.

System Admin:
System admin can view all customers policies, how much they are paying and other relevant customer data.
When claims are made by customers, it reaches the system admin who then has an option to cover the claim or respond with a rejection and a reason.
Admin has the option to add or remove customers from their current plan.
Admin also has the option to alter the logic with which premiums are calculated for all customers.
